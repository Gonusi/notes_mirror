# Notes

## TODOs for an MVP:
- Make sure user can resize notes on safari / ipad / any mobile (currently there are issues)
- Make it so users on mobile have basic functionality - header must fit, users must be able to scroll around the area of the notes. There should be some kind of minimal area for now for the notes to be displayed.
- Add ability to create notes despite not being logged in. Then, if user logs in, sync those.
- Add flow for first time visitor - create a popup with a FAQ video of 30 seconds. 
- Final MPV testing
